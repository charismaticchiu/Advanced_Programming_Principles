# Deductions from automatic grading scores.

+ 0 - 25% deduction of automated points if there is a recursive function other than ``map``, ``filter``, ``foldl``, ``foldr``, ``take``, or ``drop``.

+ 0 - 50% deduction of automated points if there is usage of a function, from a built-in OCaml module, other than ``List.sort``, ``List.dedup``, ``List.concat``, ``String.to_list``, ``String.concat``, ``Char.to_string``, ``Char.lowercase``, ``Int.to_string``, ``InChannel.read_all``, or ``compare``

+ 1 / (1) Code avoids repetition.

+ 1 / (1) Code avoids nested matches where possible.

+ 0 / (1) Code avoids if-then-else expressions where not appropriate.

+ 1 / (1) Code is structured such that redundancy in expression evaluation is avoided.

+ 1 / (1) Variables are named in an instructive fashion.

+ 1 / (1) The function ``paradelle`` has an appropriate type annotation.

+ 1 / (1) Exceptions are used only in appropriate places.
